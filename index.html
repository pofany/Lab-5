        I'm going back to 505 <br>
        If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
        In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side<br>
        With your hands between your thighs<br>
        Stop and wait a sec'<br>
        Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?<br>
        I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck<br>
        Or I did last time I checked<br>
        Not shy of a spark<br>
        A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark<br>
        Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark<br>
        The middle of adventure is such a perfect place to start<br>
        I'm going back to 505<br>
        If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
        In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side<br>
        With your hands between your thighs<br>
        But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
        It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br>
        I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise<br>
        Take my hands off of your eyes too soon<br>
        I'm going back to 505<br>
        If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive<br>
        In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side<br>
        With your hands between your thighs and a smile<br>
